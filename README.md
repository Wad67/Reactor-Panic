# Reactor-Panic
Reactor Incremental clone/remake I am working on.
TODO:
Everything.
Figure out how to host the game here on gitub.
Everything else.

Update 20/10/15
This was more or less a testbed to see If I could implement JS in a HTMl document and have it hosted here on github.
All that works, everything else that works is a bonus.

You can view the code, and the page by downloading what is currently here and opening rrpanic.html in chrome or firefox.
The terminal spits out useful information from time to time.
or you can "play" the game here: http://wad67.github.io/Reactor-Panic.
