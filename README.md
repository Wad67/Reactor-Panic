# Reactor-Panic

This is the "GH-pages" branch of the project, AKA the part that actually works.
I had to change my file structure a bit and rename a few things but it is more or less the same thing here.


Reactor Incremental clone/remake I am working on.
TODO:

Everything.
Figure out how to host the game here on gitub.
Everything else.

You can view the code, and the page by downloading what is currently here and opening rrpanic.html in chrome or firefox.
The terminal spits out useful information from time to time.
This gh-pages branch is intended for use ON github as free hosting is as good as it gets.
